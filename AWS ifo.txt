An IP address has two components, the network address and the host address. A subnet mask separates the IP address into
the network and host addresses (<network><host>). Subnetting further divides the host part of an IP address into a subnet 
and host address (<network><subnet><host>) if additional subnetwork is needed. Use the Subnet Calculator to retrieve subnetwork
 information from IP address and Subnet Mask. It is called a subnet mask because it is used to identify network address of an IP
 address by perfoming a bitwise AND operation on the netmask.
